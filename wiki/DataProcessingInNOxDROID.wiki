Analyzing sensor data in Weka

Preprocessing of location and nox data
  * Cleaning GPS and nox data

Processing of data
  * Aligning nox and location data


== Analyzing sensor data in Weka == 
Load the data from either appengine or directly from the phone see [SQLiteManagerHOWTO]

Open WEKA and load the file, see [DataProcessingInWeka]

Look at the mean, stddev, min and max. 

== Preprocessing of location and nox data == 
Here is some pseudo code for the algorithm which should process the data for a single track

{{{
N : set of noxdata of track T
G : set of locationdata of track T
K : empty set of KML datapoints 

for (gx,gy) in G : 
  N = set of nox between gx_t and gy_t (_t is timestamp of gx)
  L = ContractNOX(N)
  E.add(gx)
  E = L.size-1 extrapolated GPS between gx and gy 
  for i..L.size : 
     KML.add((L[i], E[i]))

ContractNOX(N)
   M : emptyset for noxdata
   for n in N : 
      c <- contracted point n0, n1, ni where |nh-ng| < some delta 
      M.add(c) 
   return M
}}}

Several interesting things to do when we want to show multiple tracks. 
First of all we need to do the dataprocessing in real time. The pollution level should be visualized according to selected timespan. 

  * Show tracks by a user. Ability to select/unselect individual tracks.
  * Show pollution on the map with timespan selection

Should all KML datapoints be calculated at once or can you pass the map's quadrant as arguments.
