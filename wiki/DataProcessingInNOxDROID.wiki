Analyzing sensor data in Weka

Preprocessing of location and nox data
  * Cleaning GPS and nox data

Processing of data
  * Aligning nox and location data


== Analyzing sensor data in Weka == 
Load the data from either appengine or directly from the phone see [SQLiteManagerHOWTO]

Open WEKA and load the file, see [DataProcessingInWeka]

Look at the mean, stddev, min and max. 

== Preprocessing of location and nox data == 
Here is some pseudo code for the algorithm which should process the data

{{{
N : set of noxdata of track T
G : set of locationdata of track T
for n in N : 
   contract n0, n1, ni where |ni-n(i-1)| < some delta 
}}}
