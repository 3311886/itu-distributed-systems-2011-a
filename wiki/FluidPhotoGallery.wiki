Svn (its a full eclipse project but minimal - so import it as prefered):

==== Setup ====

There is unfortunately some ip-address setup hassle involved and the application is 'raw'.



==== Protocol in use ====

TCP for send/receive images. Selected for simplicity.

Bluetooth could have been used and has the pro that a wifi-network connection is not need.

Other interesting protocols for use: NCP.
